# Decentralized Ride-Sharing Platform

## Build a decentralized platform for ride-sharing, cutting out intermediaries.

### Project Vision
The goal of this project is to develop a decentralized ride-sharing platform that eliminates intermediaries, allowing riders and drivers to interact directly on the blockchain. By leveraging smart contracts, the platform ensures secure payments and trustless ride completion, enhancing transparency and reducing costs for both parties.

### Future Scope
- **Ride Matching Algorithm**: Implement a decentralized mechanism to match riders with drivers.
- **Reputation System**: Develop a rating system for both riders and drivers to ensure trustworthiness.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Integrate surge pricing based on demand and supply.
- **Multicurrency Support**: Enable payments using various cryptocurrencies.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Introduce DAO-based governance for rule-setting and dispute resolution.

### Key Features
- **Trustless Ride Registration**: Riders can register a ride with a specified fare.
- **Secure Payment System**: Payments are handled through smart contracts, ensuring funds transfer only upon ride completion.
- **Immutable Ride Records**: All rides and transactions are stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Intermediary-Free Model**: Eliminates middlemen, reducing transaction fees and ensuring fair earnings for drivers.
- **Scalability & Security**: Designed to handle a large number of transactions securely and efficiently.
